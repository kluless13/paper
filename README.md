Assets will contain the weights for each dataset.

_Brief description_:

YOLO-REACT is a deep learning application harnessing the power of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time species detection. Our main aim is to bolster conservation management efforts by providing quick and accurate species recognition, leading to more effective monitoring and protection strategies.

We begin with COTs which are native to Australia but are very harmful to coral reef. Besdies COTs, which exists predominantly on the sea bed, we will also be creating an algorithm for Lionfish, a known invasive species in Florida. 

_Expanded description_:

YOLO-REACT is a cutting-edge deep learning application, leveraging the remarkable capabilities of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time species detection. In the age where rapid ecological changes challenge biodiversity, we believe that technology can be an ally. Our primary mission with YOLO-REACT is to supercharge conservation management endeavors. By offering instantaneous and precise species recognition, we pave the way for optimized monitoring and enhanced protection mechanisms.

The Why: Addressing Ecological Challenges

Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTs)
Native to the vast waters surrounding Australia, the Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTs) is a predatory species that feeds on coral polyps. While a natural part of the ecosystem, periodic population surges lead to extensive coral predation, which can be catastrophic for coral reefs. These outbreaks reduce coral cover, decrease biodiversity, and affect the overall health and balance of the reef ecosystem.

With YOLO-REACT, we aim to monitor these population surges and map their spread. Early detection of COTs can inform targeted response efforts, enabling conservationists to manage and possibly prevent larger outbreaks.

Lionfish

The vibrant Lionfish, originally from the Indo-Pacific, has become an invasive species in the waters of Florida and the broader Atlantic. Their rapid reproduction rate combined with a lack of natural predators in these new regions has led to an imbalance. Lionfish compete with native species for food, leading to reduced biodiversity and altered behaviors of native marine life.

Our commitment extends to creating a specialized algorithm that can identify and track the spread of Lionfish populations. By doing so, we can support initiatives that aim to control and manage their population, ensuring a balanced and thriving marine ecosystem.
