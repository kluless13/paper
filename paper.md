### Introduction

The emergence of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies has sparked a new era of scientific investigation in various fields, including marine ecology, which has gained particular attention *[1,2]*.The effectiveness of computational tools in efficiently and precisely analyzing large datasets has empowered marine ecologists to develop novel tools, thereby enhancing our comprehension and control of marine ecosystems. The issue of invasive species poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems, adding to the numerous challenges they already face. The introduction of non-native species into new habitats can have significant impacts on the ecological equilibrium, leading to negative consequences for the environment and economy.

In marine ecosystems, the presence of invasive species has been observed to disrupt ecological relationships, resulting in negative consequences. For example, there has been a correlation between the occurrence of outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTs) and a notable decrease in coral abundance throughout the Great Barrier Reef over the course of the last forty years. When starfish populations reach a state of outbreak, they exhibit a consumption rate of coral tissues that exceeds the rate of coral growth. This poses a substantial risk to the long-term health and resilience of the reef, particularly in light of climate change *[3,4,5]*. In the same manner, it's also significant that the Lionfish has rapidly infiltrated the Atlantic coastal waters, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico within the United States. This phenomenon has raised significant apprehension due to their predatory behavior towards indigenous fish species and their absence of natural predators, thereby intensifying their invasive capabilities *(6,7)*.

The cybernetic perspective, which conceptualizes ecosystems as systems that process information, presents a new paradigm for understanding and tackling the challenges posed by invasive species. The utilization of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms holds the potential to decipher the complex information networks present in marine ecosystems, thus enabling the creation of tools for real-time monitoring and management. These tools play a crucial role in the timely identification and management of invasive species risks, thereby bolstering the ability of marine ecosystems to withstand and recover from such invasions *(8)*.

The study aims to achieve two primary objectives:

- The first aim is to highlight the differences between the YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 model inferences. Edge devices, due to their inherent ability to perform data processing at the location of data collection, present a highly promising opportunity for the real-time monitoring of marine ecosystems.

- The second objective of this study is to examine the different types of targets found in marine ecosystems and propose appropriate models for object detection in each case. The overall goal of this study is to provide marine ecologists with a comprehensive toolkit that can be customized to suit specific monitoring and management goals, through a thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses inherent in various models.

This study aims to bridge the gap between marine science and machine learning by conducting a comparative analysis of YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 in the detection and identification of invasive species, specifically COTs and Lionfish. Furthermore, this study provides a foundation for future investigations focused on exploring the cybernetic characteristics of marine ecosystems, thereby enhancing our comprehensive comprehension of the interconnectedness and reciprocal relationships intrinsic to these intricate ecological networks *(9)*.

- The paper titled "A Taxonomy of Regularization for Deep Learning" explores different regularization methods aimed at addressing the issue of overfitting. These techniques can be advantageous in promoting the generalization ability of models when applied to novel data *[3]*

One limitation arises from the training of models on a single class of objects, whether it be Crown of Throns Starfish (COTs) or Lionfish. This limitation pertains to the model's capacity to accurately differentiate between multiple classes in intricate real-world situations. The exclusive emphasis on a single class may restrict the model's learning to particular characteristics of that class, potentially disregarding the broader distinguishing attributes necessary for distinguishing among multiple classes. The models' generalization capability could be improved by training them on multiple classes. This would allow them to acquire a broader set of features and enhance their ability to differentiate between various classes in real-world, multi-class situations.

By acknowledging the potential issue of overfitting and incorporating multi-class training, it is plausible to enhance the resilience and generalizability of the models, rendering them more appropriate for intricate marine ecological scenarios.
