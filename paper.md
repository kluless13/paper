### Abstract

Title: Real-Time Detection of Invasive Marine Species: A Comparative Study of YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 Models

Marine ecosystems face significant challenges from the presence of invasive species, such as the Crown Of Thorns Starfish (COTs) and Lionfish. The timely identification of these species is crucial in order to implement effective management strategies. This study conducted a comparative analysis of the YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 machine learning models in order to assess their effectiveness in real-time detection of the aforementioned species. The main goals of this study were to investigate model inferences and suggest appropriate object detection models for a wide range of marine targets. The YOLOv7 model demonstrated an F1 Score of 0.95 for the Lionfish dataset and 0.82 for the COTs dataset. In contrast, the YOLOv8 model exhibited a more consistent performance, achieving F1 Scores of 0.96 and 0.92 for the Lionfish and COTs datasets, respectively. Further, YOLOv8 demonstrated a true positive prediction confidence of 95% on the COTs dataset, thereby indicating its improved accuracy in comparison to YOLOv7. The results emphasize the practicality of utilizing these models on edge devices for the purpose of real-time monitoring, thereby making a valuable contribution to the field of marine ecosystem management. This study additionally establishes a foundation for comprehending marine ecosystems through a cybernetic lens, thereby connecting the domains of information science and marine science. The aforementioned findings hold significant importance for worldwide marine conservation endeavors and facilitate a more profound examination of marine ecosystems from a cybernetic perspective.

### Introduction

The emergence of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) technologies represents a significant shift in scientific investigation across various fields, particularly in the realm of marine ecology. The computational methodologies encompassed within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have exhibited remarkable aptitude in analyzing large datasets with a combination of accuracy and efficiency. As a result, marine ecologists possess innovative tools that enhance our comprehension and capacity for managing marine ecosystems [1,2].

The issue of invasive species poses a significant challenge to marine ecosystems, further complicating the already formidable obstacles they face. The introduction of non-native species into unfamiliar environments can significantly disrupt the ecological equilibrium, resulting in negative consequences for both the natural ecosystem and the economy. For example, there is a correlation between the occurrence of outbreaks of Crown Of Thorns starfish (COTs) and the substantial depletion of coral in the Great Barrier Reef during the last forty years. In similar fashion, the rapid colonization of Lionfish in the Atlantic coastal waters, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico has raised significant concerns due to their predatory behavior and absence of natural predators, thereby amplifying their invasive capabilities (6,7).

The cybernetic perspective, which emerged in the 1940s, focuses on the study of systems and processes that involve self-interaction and self-regeneration, such as those found in marine ecology. The utilization of this transdisciplinary methodology provides a structured approach for examining and comprehending the complex interconnections, self-regulating patterns, and adaptive capacities that are inherent in marine ecosystems. The cybernetic lens provides a conceptual framework for understanding ecosystems as systems that process information. This perspective offers a new paradigm for comprehending and tackling the challenges posed by invasive species.

The integration of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and cybernetics in the field of marine science provides a comprehensive comprehension of marine ecosystems, emphasizing a systems-based approach. The integration of multiple disciplines allows for the examination of the flow of information within marine ecosystems, as well as their inherent ability to organize themselves, adapt, and respond to environmental disturbances, such as the introduction of non-native species. This study explores the utilization of YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models, which combine machine learning, deep learning, and cybernetic principles. The aim is to propose a novel approach for conducting real-time monitoring and analysis of marine ecosystems.

The study focuses primarily in achieving two main objectives:

1. This study aims to highlight the distinguishing characteristics between the YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models, with a specific focus on model comparison and edge computing. The inherent ability of edge devices to perform data processing at the location of data collection presents a promising opportunity for the real-time monitoring of marine ecosystems.

2. This study aims to investigate various targets present in marine ecosystems and suggest suitable models for detecting these objects in different scenarios. This will enable us to provide marine ecologists with a comprehensive set of tools that can be tailored to meet specific monitoring and management goals. This will be achieved by developing a nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of different models.

The aim of this study is to establish a connection between the fields of marine science, cybernetics and machine learning. This will be achieved by conducting a comparative analysis of two machine learning models, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, in their ability to detect and identify invasive species, specifically Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTs) and Lionfish. Further, this research establishes the fundamental basis for future investigations focused on exploring the cybernetic characteristics of marine ecosystems, thereby enhancing our comprehensive understanding of the interconnected and mutually dependent relationships inherent in these intricate ecological networks (9).

In conclusion, the integration of machine learning and cybernetics in the field of marine science, exemplified by the application of YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models for the real-time detection and identification of invasive species, enhances our ability to observe and manage marine ecosystems. This methodology enhances both our ability to observe and manage, while also creating an environment that is favorable for additional interdisciplinary exploration. This collaborative initiative aims to address the ecological challenges presented by invasive species by integrating the fields of data science, marine science, and cybernetics. In doing so, it seeks to make a meaningful contribution to the wider discourse on marine ecosystem management and conservation.

   - The YOLO algorithm utilizes a singular convolutional network to perform simultaneous predictions of multiple bounding boxes and their corresponding class probabilities.   
   - In contrast to conventional approaches that involve applying the classifier to an image at various locations and scales, YOLO, or "You Only Look Once," operates by passing the image through the network only once.

### 2. **Grid System:**
   - The grid system is a method used in design and layout to organize content and elements on a page. 
   - It involves dividing the page into a series of columns and rows, creating a grid structure. 
   - This grid structure helps to establish a consistent and balanced layout. 
   - The algorithm partitions the image into a grid, typically with dimensions of 13x13. 

### 3. **Bounding Box Predictions:**
   - Each individual cell within the grid is tasked with making predictions for bounding boxes.
   - Each prediction for a bounding box includes the coordinates of the box, a confidence score, and probabilities for different classes. 

### 4. **Anchor Boxes:**
   - Subsequent iterations of the YOLO algorithm incorporated the integration of anchor boxes, which are pre-defined shapes, to enhance the network's ability to accurately predict bounding boxes with varying shapes and sizes.
   - Anchor boxes are instrumental in enhancing the precision of object detection, particularly for objects that exhibit diverse aspect ratios.

### 5. **Loss Function:**
   - The YOLO algorithm incorporates a custom loss function that takes into account three distinct components: localization loss, classification loss, and confidence loss. 
   - Localization loss pertains to the discrepancy between the predicted and actual bounding box coordinates. 
   - Classification loss refers to the disparity between the predicted and actual class labels. 
   - Lastly, confidence loss accounts for the disparity between the predicted and actual confidence scores.
   - The utilization of this loss function facilitates the model's acquisition of the ability to accurately predict bounding boxes in conjunction with correct class labels.

### 6. **Multi-Scale Training:**
   - Following variations of YOLO incorporated the technique of multi-scale training, enabling the model to effectively identify objects of diverse dimensions.
   - During the training process, the network undergoes adjustments to accommodate various resolutions, thereby enhancing its ability to detect objects of different sizes and ultimately improving overall detection performance.

### 7. **Darknet Framework:**
   - The Darknet framework is often used in YOLO implementations. It is an open-source neural network framework that is coded in C and CUDA.
   - The program itself is optimized for efficient execution and convenient installation, specifically customized to meet the architectural requirements of YOLO.

### 8. **Advancements in YOLO Versions:**
   - With the progression of each iteration, such as YOLOv2, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and so on, various improvements have been incorporated to enhance the accuracy and speed of object detection. These enhancements include better predictions for anchor boxes, the addition of more convolutional layers, and the introduction of additional features such as detection at multiple scales.

### 9. **Integration of Other Architectures:**
   - The latest iterations of object detection models, such as YOLOv4 and YOLOv5, have incorporated architectural elements and methodologies from other highly effective models in the field. Notably, YOLOv4 has integrated the CSPDarknet53 backbone, PANet, and SAM block, among others, to enhance its overall performance.

### 10. **Real-Time Processing:**
   - The architectural design of YOLO is specifically tailored to enable real-time object detection, facilitating rapid inference while maintaining satisfactory accuracy. Consequently, YOLO is well-suited for applications that necessitate real-time processing and detection capabilities.

**Real-time detection using YOLOv7 and YOLOv8**:

YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 are object detection models commonly used in computer vision applications, providing real-time detection capabilities *[1]*. The architecture employed in this study is based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This architecture enables efficient and fast processing and analysis of images, enabling real-time detection and recognition of objects in marine environments *[2,3,4]*.

**Comparative analysis of YOLOv7 vs. YOLOv8**:

YOLOv8 improves upon YOLOv7 by enhancing the speed of object detection, resulting in a higher Frames Per Second (FPS) rate. This improvement is crucial for real-time applications that require efficient object detection. *[2]*. The observed speed enhancement does not appear to have a detrimental effect on the accuracy of the model, thereby demonstrating the superior efficiency of YOLOv8 in real-time object detection scenarios.

Ultralytics, the developers of YOLOv5, released YOLOv8 as an advanced model for object detection and image segmentation, succeeding YOLOv7 *[1,3]*. The primary focus of the comparison between YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 lies in the enhancements made in terms of speed and efficiency in real-time object detection. YOLOv8 distinguishes itself by achieving a higher frames per second (FPS) rate *[2,4]*.

- **Description of data sources and collection methods**:
    - The present section provides an overview of the data sources utilized in this study as well as the methods employed for data collection. The datasets employed in this research were carefully selected from Roboflow, a publicly available platform designed for the collection and dissemination of machine learning datasets (site citation). In order to conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 in species identification, two separate datasets were compiled. One dataset focused on Lionfish, while the other dataset focused on Crown of Thorns starfish (COTs).
    
    - **Lionfish Dataset**:
        - The dataset of Lionfish consists of a total of 955 images, which have been divided into training, validation, and test sets. Specifically, the dataset consists of 786 images for the training set, 112 images for the validation set, and 57 images for the test set. The proper categorization of these datasets is crucial in order to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the models' efficacy at various stages of the machine learning process, spanning from the training phase to the testing phase.
    
    - **COTs Dataset**:
        -The COTs dataset comprises a total of 3361 images, distributed as follows: 3082 images for the training set, 227 images for the validation set, and 52 images for the test set. The process of segmentation enables a thorough evaluation of the models' ability to accurately detect and quantify COTs in diverse marine environments.

#### Enhancements of Custom Datasets

- **Techniques used to improve dataset quality**:
    - Preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied to the datasets prior to model training, with the objective of improving their quality and enhancing the models' ability to handle variations in input data.
    - **Lionfish Dataset**:
        - The images underwent an initial preprocessing step in which they were automatically oriented to ensure a consistent orientation throughout the dataset. Following that, the images underwent a process of resizing wherein they were stretched to a resolution of 1028x1028 pixels. This particular resolution was chosen as it is optimal for preserving the crucial features required for precise identification of species. Furthermore, the dataset was subjected to augmentations in order to enhance its diversity and promote better generalization of the model. In this study, brightness augmentations were conducted to simulate different lighting conditions encountered in marine environments. The brightness levels were varied within a range of -30% to +30%.
    - **COTs Dataset**:
        - Similar to the Lionfish dataset, the images in the COTs dataset were automatically oriented. The process of resizing involved stretching the images to a resolution of 416x416 pixels, a choice that strikes a balance between resolution and computational efficiency. The applied augmentations included Shear transformations of ±15° in both horizontal and vertical directions to replicate potential variations in perspective. Additionally, Cutout augmentations were employed, consisting of 5 boxes of 12% size each. These augmentations were intended to enhance the model's resilience against occlusions and varying field-of-view situations.
#### Model Training and Evaluation

The process of training and evaluating a model is a crucial aspect of machine learning. It involves the development and refinement of a model using a dataset, followed by the assessment of its performance. This iterative process aims to optimize the model's ability to make accurate

- **Training Procedure**:
    - After the completion of dataset construction and enhancement, the Lionfish and COTs datasets were utilized to train both the YOLOv7 and YOLOv8s models. The training protocol was implemented by varying the number of epochs for each model in order to enhance their learning and generalization capacities. In this regard, the YOLOv8s models underwent a training process spanning 75 epochs, thereby facilitating an ample number of iterations for the models to acquire information and exhibit solid performance across the datasets.
    - The YOLOv7 models, however, underwent training for a total of 55 epochs, which is consistent with the architectural and computational constraints of the model.
    - The training procedure consisted of several phases, which involved an initial training on the designated training dataset, subsequent validation on a separate validation dataset, and finally, fine-tuning to optimize the performance and accuracy of the models.

- **Model Testing**:
    - Following the completion of the training phase, the models underwent thorough testing using the specified test sets derived from the Lionfish and COTs datasets. The objective of the testing phase was to assess the F1 score, Precision score, Recall score, Precision-Recall score, and real-time detection capabilities of the models within a controlled environment, thereby establishing a benchmark for their performance.

- **Real-world Video Analysis**:
    - In the context of real-world video analysis, it is important to consider various factors that may impact the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. These factors include the quality of the video footage, the presence of noise or interference, and the limitations of the video Following the completion of the testing phase, the trained models were implemented on authentic video data of Lionfish and COTs in real-world settings. The purpose of this step was to evaluate the efficacy and dependability of the models in real-world, dynamic marine environments. The analysis of the video also yielded valuable insights into the real-time detection and tracking capabilities of the models, thereby showcasing their potential usefulness in current and future studies related to marine ecology.

### Results

Assessing the performance of the models is an essential undertaking in order to fully understand their efficacy and suitability in practical marine ecological contexts. This section presents the results of the quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted after the completion of the training and testing phases.

#### Quantitative Results

- **Numerical data and findings**:
    - The primary emphasis of the quantitative evaluation was on comprehending the performance of the models in relation to their accuracy, speed, and ability to detect in real-time. The numerical findings provide a robust basis for comparing the models and understanding their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios.

#### Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics are quantitative measures used to assess the performance or effectiveness of a system, model, algorithm, or process. These metrics provide objective and standardized ways to evaluate and compare

A thorough assessment was carried out, considering multiple metrics, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the performance of the models on the Lionfish and COTs datasets. The evaluated metrics encompass F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and Precision-Recall. The examination of the confusion matrix was also conducted for each model.

#### YOLOv7 Evaluation

The table below elucidates the performance of the YOLOv7 model on both datasets:

| Dataset/Metric | F1 Score | Precision | Recall | Precision-Recall |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|:----------------:|
| Lionfish       |   0.95   |   1.00    |  1.00  |       0.97       |
| COTs           |   0.82   |   1.00    |  1.00  |       0.88       |

The YOLOv7 model demonstrated exceptional performance on the Lionfish dataset, achieving an F1 Score of 0.95. However, a noticeable decrease in performance was observed when evaluating the Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTs) dataset, resulting in an F1 Score of 0.82. The uniformity of Precision and Recall metrics across the datasets underscores the model's resilience, although there is still potential for enhancing its ability to detect COTs.


#### YOLOv8 Evaluation

The subsequent table delineates the performance metrics of the YOLOv8 model:

| Dataset/Metric | F1 Score | Precision | Recall | Precision-Recall |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|:----------------:|
| Lionfish       |   0.96   |   1.00    |  0.98  |      0.98        |
| COTs           |   0.92   |   1.00    |  0.97  |      0.95        |

On the other hand, the YOLOv8 model exhibited a relatively stable performance on both datasets, showing only a slight disparity in F1 Scores between Lionfish and COTs. The model demonstrates exceptional performance in accurately detecting and categorizing Lionfish and COTs, as evidenced by its high Precision and Recall values. This suggests that the model holds promise for practical applications in the field of marine species identification.

The main objective of this study was to assess and analyze the efficacy of YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models in the domain of real-time object detection within marine environments. The primary objective of this study was to examine the precise identification and classification of Lionfish and Crown Of Thorns starfish (COTs). The evaluation was carried out meticulously, taking into account various metrics including F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and Precision-Recall. The aforementioned methodology was utilized in order to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the performance of the models.

The selected evaluation metrics, namely F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Precision-Recall, and Confusion Matrix, play a crucial role in comprehending the effectiveness of classification models. The rationale for selecting these metrics, in addition to their corresponding mathematical expressions, are as follows:

1. F1 Score:
The F1 Score is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of a model. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. The scoring system is defined on a scale from 0 to 1, with a score of 1 representing optimal precision and recall.

\[ F1 = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{ \text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall} }{ \text{Precision} + \text{Recall} } \right) \]

2. Precision:
Precision can be defined as the proportion of accurately predicted positive observations in relation to the overall number of predicted positives. It is of utmost importance when the expenses associated with False Positive outcomes are substantial.

\[ \text{Precision} = \frac{ \text{True Positive} }{ \text{True Positive} + \text{False Positive} } \]

3. Recall:
Recall, also known as Sensitivity, is a metric that quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations relative to all observations in the actual class. When the cost associated with a False Negative is significant, it becomes imperative.
The precision metric can be defined as the ratio of true positive instances to the sum of true positive and false positive instances.

\[ \text{Recall} = \frac{ \text{True Positive} }{ \text{True Positive} + \text{False Negative} } \]

4. Precision-Recall:
The Precision-Recall metric serves as a valuable indicator of prediction performance in scenarios where there is a significant class imbalance. It serves to demonstrate the inherent trade-off between precision and recall.

5. Confusion Matrix:
The Confusion Matrix provides a matrix-based depiction of the performance of a classifier, illustrating the occurrences of true and false positives and negatives. The evaluation of the model's performance across various classes is crucial for comprehending its effectiveness and aids in the detection of misclassifications.

These metrics were chosen for several reasons:
